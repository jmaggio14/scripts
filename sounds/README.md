# scripts/sounds
Some stupid sound effects to use for notifications when a script finishes.

Here's an explanation of what each sound is supposed to be:
* **airhorn.mp3**: an obnoxious airhorn sound
* **dundun.mp3**: the "DUN DUN" sound from _Law & Order_
* **easybtn.mp3**: Staples' easy button noise
* **fanfare.mp3**: victorious trumpet fanfare from _Final Fantasy V_
* **gg.mp3**: shouting "GG!!!"
* **heylisten.mp3**: Navi from _Legend of Zelda_ games
* **inception.mp3**: dramatic noise from the movie _Inception_
* **priceiswrong.mp3**: losing horn from _The Price is Right_
* **quack.mp3**: a duck
* **wilhelm.mp3**: the infamous [Wilhelm scream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_scream)
* **wololo.mp3**: priest sound effect from _Age of Empires_
* **womp.mp3**: sad trombone
* **xperror.mp3**: the classic error noise from Windows XP

Some day I'll convert these all to Ogg Vorbis sounds and accept free software
as my lord and savior, but today I'm lazy.
